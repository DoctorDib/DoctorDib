**VimJam 2: Boss [8Bits to Infinity] - Demoted:**
**A 7 day GameJam** that took place on **10th September 2021** with a base theme of **"On the Edge"**. My chosen game was designed to keep the users on the edge of their seats making sure that they always had to be vigilant.

We decided as a group that we would like to take this game to the next level by fixing all current bugs and adding new levels and AI.
